# Bosh's Tech Notes

This repository contains the source code for [notes.boshkuo.com](https://notes.boshkuo.com/), a website built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Introduction
This website is a `knowledge notes repository` of my learning journey as a `software engineer`, and it primarily consists of notes and articles sourced from various online resources. As I continue to explore new technologies and programming concepts, I document my findings and share them on this platform to help fellow learners and aspiring developers. Through this website, I hope to contribute to the open-source community and foster a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration among software engineers.

## Local Development
his will start a local development server and open the website in your default browser. As you make changes to the code, the website will be automatically reloaded.
```shell
# npm
npm run start

# yarn
yarn start
```

## Build
```
# npm
npm run build

# yarn 
yarn build
```
building command generates static content into the build directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deploy

I Deploy my own Docusaurus project with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
